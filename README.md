# Puissance-4/ Mael-Kehl

A simple Puissance 4 game coded to learn java and object programming.

I've put some colors to make it look like the IRL game and "security" to avoid input errors.
Special thanks to Kallu who helped me to fix some bugs and gave me feddbacks.

The game still in developpement and isn't windows friendly yet (but who cares ?).
